* Create a new file `(short language).json` from the root folder and just copy all from `en.json`
* Translate by editing the value from the key like `"Search": "(your translation of 'Search')"`
* From `"Translator": "(your name of your choice)"`, Put your name in value of your choice. This will be in a translation credits.
* If you are done and made some changes, use `git add -A` (Git termial) to stage changes then `git commit -m "(anything)"` to commit staged changes.
* Push your commits to the remote `git push origin (your branch)`, If you are done with your commits and ready to talk about your translation from `Pull Request`, Go to https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodots-locale then click `Pull Requests` and create new one from the branch you created.
Base: `master`, Head/Compare: `(your branch)`

* Rules are simple, Don't make changes to the `en.json` file
